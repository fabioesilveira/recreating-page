        paragraph:"As with most EVs, the Model 3 gains speed quickly, smoothly, and almost silently, with the electric motor providing a strong punch from a stop. And it's fastâ€”extremely so in some trims. Like all Teslas, the Model 3 carries its battery under the floor, resulting in a low center of gravity. The 60 mph time for the Model 3 Long Range in our test was 4.1 seconds.",

As shown, the Roadster concept features a removable glass panel roof, which you can stow in the trunk. It has four seats, but the rear ones look as though they may not fit adults, given the Roadster's dramatically angled roofline. Other than that, we expect to see Tesla's signature minimalist interior design repeated here.",
